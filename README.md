# AI Agents for E-commerce using PydanticAI

This repository shows how to build AI agents to automate customer support and order management in e-commerce applications using the PydanticAI library.

It showcases two example agents for a fashion e-commerce store:

1. A **support agent** that assists customers by answering their questions using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).**
2. An **order management agent** that processes complex operations like updates, returns and cancellations.
